# Animated  Word Cloud in Economics

This project creates an animated word cloud of word frequencies (n-grams of n = 1) of article titles in top 5 economic journals since 1886.
We use the core framework of the WordSwarm project (https://github.com/thisIsMikeKane/WordSwarm). 
The results are described in these papers:
